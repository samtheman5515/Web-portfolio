<div id="lyrics">  Carry on my wayward son <br>
For there'll be peace when you are done <br>
Lay your weary head to rest <br>
Don't you cry no more <br> <br>
Once I rose above the noise and confusion <br>
Just to get a glimpse beyond the illusion <br>
I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high <br>
Though my eyes could see I still wa a blind man <br>
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man <br>
I hear the voices when I'm dreamin', I can hear them say <br> <br>
Carry on my wayward son <br>
For there'll be peace when you are done <br>
Lay your weary head to rest <br>
Don't you cry no more <br> <br>
Masquerading as a man with a reason <br>
My charade is the event of the season <br>
And if I claim to be a wise man, it surely means that I don't know <br>
On a stormy sea of moving emotion <br>
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean <br>
I set a course for winds of fortune, but I hear the voices say <br> <br>
Carry on my wayward son <br>
For there'll be peace when you are done <br>
Lay your weary head to rest <br>
Don't you cry no more <br> <br>
Carry on, you will always remember <br>
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor <br>
Now your life's no longer empty <br> 
Surely heaven waits for you <br> <br>
Carry on my wayward son <br>
For there'll be peace when you are done <br>
Lay your weary head to rest <br>
Don't you cry no more  <br>

Carry on my wayward son
For there'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond the illusion
I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high
Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreamin', I can hear them say
Carry on my wayward son
For there'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, it surely means that I don't know
On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune, but I hear the voices say
Carry on my wayward son
For there'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
Carry on, you will always remember
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
Surely heaven waits for you
Carry on my wayward son
For there'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
